### How to play
Use the arrow keys to move your character, and press the Z key to attack. The bars in the upper left corner represent the player's remaining health and energy levels. Each time the player hits the boss, they accumulate 1 energy point. When the energy level is at least 3, press the X key to consume three energy points and fire a shockwave forward. The upper right corner displays the boss's remaining health. The player wins when the boss's health reaches zero and fails when their health reaches zero.
