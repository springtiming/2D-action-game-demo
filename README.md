Welcome to the GitHub page for Mike's Fantasy â€“ an action-packed side-scrolling game demo filled with humor and whimsy. This game parodies my high school friend Mike with funny animations and voiceovers. Developed using Scratch and packaged as an executable file for easy play, Mike's Fantasy offers a delightful gaming experience despite its small size.
